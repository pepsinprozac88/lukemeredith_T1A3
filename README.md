- My application, SuperNotes, is a terminal application designed to do three things: take notes, read those note, and delete those notes if necessary. SuperNote takes input from a user in the form of a note title and note content, then opens a text file and saves the user's input (the note heading and content) to the text file along with the date which the note was created. The user can also use SuperNote to look through a list of their created notes, or search for them by name, and either edit the note or delete the note. Basically, SuperNote is super basic. But it works, and it's super. 
- It will solve all the client's note taking needs; even though there are hundreds of other note-taking apps on the market, you can rest assured that none of them take a note as SUPERbly as SuperNote!
- The target audience is anyone who wants to jump in on the fast-paced and always-expanding world of note-taking. From office workers to soccer-mums, if you need to take a note, we got the app for you!
- I could explain how to use it here, under the Requirement 5 heading as asked, but I feel like that's a bit silly as Requirement 10 asks for the same thing, and I don't want to repeat myself. I got things to do.

### Feature 1 - Create New Note

The first and most essential feature of SuperNote is it's ability to create a new note. When choosing th *New* option, the user is prompted for a note title (which can be multiple words, as the app will fill in whitespace with underscores'_' and add the '.txt' file extention automatically). If the note title is already in use, the app will tell the user that the title is unavailable. After successfully giving the note a title, the user then iputs the content of their note, and upon saving, the note is transformed into a text file, with a header that includes the owner of the note, the note title, and the date which the note was created. 

### Feature 2 - Read Your Notes

The second feature is, of course, the ability to read your notes. The *Read* option lists all created notes. Rather than having to scroll up and down through the list of notes, the user can instead open the note by simply typing in the note's title (again, no need to add the '.txt' extension and any underscores '_').

### Feature 3  - Edit Your Notes

The third feature gives the user the ability to edit pre-existing notes. Pretty simple.

### Feature 4 - Delete Unwanted Notes

The final feature of SuperNote is the ability to list all existing notes, search by name (again, sans underscores'_' and '.txt' file extensions) and delete them from the list. It's pretty super.
