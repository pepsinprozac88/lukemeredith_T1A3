Welcome to SuperNotes!

To get started, first download the supernotes app from GitHub:

https://github.com/pepsinprozac88/lukemeredith_T1A3

Systewm Requirments:

- Any modern PC at least 5-10 years old
- Bash shell
- the ability to read, write and type is somewhat helpful


SETUP GUIDE

1. Once downloaded, open your terminal window and navigate to the directory in which Supernote has been stored.
2. Navigate to the *src* directory.
3. First we need to install the dependencies (Ruby gems). While inside the *src* directory, run the following command:  bundle install
4. Once the bundled dependencies are install, you can launch Supernotes! you can do this using the binary file in *src* by typing the following command:  ./supernotes
5. The app should open right there in your terminal window :)
*Note:* should you need quick access to this help document, you can read in in the terminal, provided you are in the Supernote *src* directory, by using the following command:  ruby supernoteshelp --help OR ruby supernoteshelp -h


Using Supernotes:

*Note:* Supernotes is a user friendly application. All instructions are in-app, spelled out clearly in the terminal app for the user's convenience. 

Supernotes main page is simply a title screen with the navigation menu below it. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the options and press the 'enter' key to select.

*Read* - This option will list all existing notes and allow you to type in the name of the note you would like to read and press enter. Note that you *can* have spaces in the note title, and you do *not* have to add the .txt file extension at the end of the title; Supernotes automates these process for you by replacing spaces with underscores ('_') and adding the file extension for you!

*New* - Creates a new note. Follow the instructions on screen. Note that you cannot create a note without a title, or create a note that shares an existing note's title. Your note can also be multi-lined; though pressing the 'enter' key three times without inputting text will end the note and save it to Supernote's 'src' directory in .txt format.

*Delete* - Use this option to delete an existing notes. Supernotes again gives you a list of all exisiting notes from which you can choose the note you wish to delete by typing in the name of the note (sans the .txt file extension and '_'s). To avoid accidental deletion, the user is asked one last time if they are sure they wish to delete the current file. Note than deleting a note is permanent; deleting notes in-app will also delete the associated .txt file from the 'src' directory.

*Append* - This feature allows the user to open an exisitng note using the same method as mentioned previously (read a list and tyoe the note name etc.) Once the note is selected, the app prompts the user for additional note text which will be saved *to the end* of the note when the enter key is pressed three times (again allowing multi-lined text to be typed into the command line).

*Exit* - Closes the Supernotes app, with grace :)


Exporting notes (or, accessing the files at their source):

If you wish, you can retrieve the actual text file version of your note for use in other software, editing, printing, etc. The note files are created and stored in Supernote's /src directory, in filename.txt format. Note that if you remove or delete the file directly from the /src directory you will no longer be able to access it from within the Supernotes program.


Troublshooting: 

Honestly, there's not much to the Supernotes app; there are no known errors, and all known user-related errors are addressed in app with instructions as to why the user may have recieved said error. If the app does freeze, the user can use Ctr-Z or Ctr-Z to force-close the program, and restart it using the method stated previously. If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling the program as per the instruction above, or else feel free to contact me with questions or issues through my GitHub page.
